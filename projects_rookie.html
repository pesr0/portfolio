                            This program was the first Back End program I did. It was done as part of the ONE program.
                            <br>
                            The main idea for the program was a currency converter program. The main proposal was a program with fixed
                            currency converter rates, but this one was done with an <b>API</b> with minute updated currency rates. However, it
                            has both proposed version (Challenge Version) and My Version of the program.
                            <br>
                            For this program no framework were used. Only <b>Java</b>, IDE Eclipse and <b>Apache Maven</b> were used. 
                            You can find the program repository below:

                            This program was another program that I worked on by myself. I realized that it was very laborious to start a WhatsApp chat without having
                            the targtet number in your personal contacts. So I wrote a simple code to start a chat with a WhatsApp number without the need to add that number
                            to personal contacts. The script works both on WhatsApp web version and phone version

                            This project was the first coding project I ever did, it was done as part of the ONE program in format of a challenge.
                            It is basically a cipher (both an encoder and a decoder). You insert a text you want to encrypt, and than the program returns the encrypted format.
                            <br>
                            This program also implements some restrictions, e.g. you may not insert uppercase letters. And it has a button to copy the generated content.

                            This project was the second project I worked on. It was  a personal project aimed at learning and improving my coding skils.
                            <br>
                            It consists in a To-Do List organizer where you may insert tasks you want to do and check them as it gets done.
                            In this program you are able to generate inumerous lists and insert tasks into them, as well as add a title for each list. 
                            The program also has a guide for use, with more details for use.
