                            Hi! Welcome to my portfolio of coding projects.
                            I am Pedro, a 23-years-old Brazilian student pursuing a <b>Materials Engineering</b> degree at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul) since 2018 and expecting to graduate by the midst of 2024.
                            <br>
                            You may be wondering how I got into coding while studying Materials Engineering, which is mostly related to Chemistry. Actually, it's quite simple:
                            <br>
                            At some point during my degree (I really don't remember exactly when), I took a class that introduced us to the C language. 
                            While my classmates hated it, I very much enjoyed it, and that's when I realized that programming is all about <b>challenges and logic</b>. 
                            Since then, I've been studying programming and focusing more on related topics.
                            I was a student at <b>Oracle Next Education (ONE)</b> program, from Oracle, where I learned programming languages such as 
                            <b>Java Object-Oriented and Spring Framework</b>, data related topics such as <b>SQL</b>,
                            as well as improved my personal skills. 
                            As part of ONE I have also been challenged to create programs based on initial ideas and proposals.
                            In addition, I am studying and working <b>Python</b> especially in Data Science 
                            <br>
                            As part of my degree program, I also diid an internship at the <b>"Instituto SENAI de Inovação (ISI) em Engenharia de Polímeros"</b>, 
                            which was focused on developing <b>innovative</b> products to meet industry demands. 
                            This institute is inspired on the German <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>.
                            <br>
                            Today I am an intern at <b>Braskem</b> company, where I work with <b>Data Science, Labs Digitalization and Innovation</b> applied to polymeric materials, 
                            and beacuse of that I am able to continuosly improve my coding, Data Science skills and enrich my graduation.
                            <br>
                            I'm always learning new things, using <b>creativity</b> to solve problems and thirsty for <b>innovation</b>. I believe that under certain point of view
                            everthing can be interesting.
                            <br>
                            All of my projects, including personal projects and ONE challenge projects, will be listed on this portfolio. 
                            Here, you can find some basic information about them. 
                            However, if you are interested in more detailed information, you can always read the README file on the GitHub project page or even ask me.
                            <br>
                            If you got interested in contacting me for any reason, you can find my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles at the bottom of this page,
