                            HiüòÅ! Welcome to my portfolio of coding projectsüíª.
                            I am Pedro, a Brazilian Materials <b>Engineer</b> graduated at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), but today my main focus is on <b>Data Science</b>.
                            <br>
                            You may be wondering how I got into coding/data Science while studying Materials Engineering, which is mostly related to Chemistry. Actually, it's quite simple:
                            <br>
                            At some point during my degree (I really don't remember exactly when), I took a class that introduced me to the <b>C language</b>. 
                            While my classmates hated it, I very much enjoyed it, and that's when I realized that programming is all about <b>challengesüéØ and logicüßê</b>. 
                            Since then, I've been studying programming and focusing more on related topics.
                            I was a student at <b>Oracle Next Education (ONE)</b> program, from Oracle, where I learned programming languages such as 
                            <b>Java Object-Oriented and Spring Framework</b>, data related topics such as <b>SQL</b>,
                            as well as improved my <b>soft skills</b>. 
                            As part of ONE I have also been challenged to create programs based on initial ideas and proposals.
                            In addition, I was studying about <b>Python</b> focused on <b>Data Science and data manipulation</b> 
                            as a part of a Bootcamp sponsored by Fundo Amanh√£ and BAH Group, exclusively for UFRGS Students.  
                            <br>
                            As part of my degree program, I also did an internship at the <b>"Instituto SENAI de Inova√ß√£o (ISI) em Engenharia de Pol√≠meros"</b>, 
                            which was focused on developing <b>innovative</b>üí° projects to meet industry demands, and also focused on presenting tests results,
                            sharpening my skilss on <b>data Visualization</b>. 
                            This institute is inspired on the German <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>.
                            <br>
                            I was also an intern at <b>Braskem</b> company, where I worked with <b>Data Science, Labs Digitalization and Innovation</b> applied to polymeric materials, 
                            and because of that improved my coding and Data Science skills and enrich my graduation. In this internship experience, all projects
                            I worked required <b>data treat and exploration</b>, which was done mainly with <b>Python, Pandas and Numpy</b>, 
                            <b>Data Visualization</b> (done with Matplotlib and Seaborn) also some projects required others
                            technologies such as Image Featurization with <b>OpenCV, PIL and scikit-image</b>, Machine Learning with <b>scikit-learn</b>, signal exploration manipulation
                            with <b>scipy</b>, RPA (automation) with <b>TKinter and Pyautogui</b>, Data Visualization with <b>matplotlib, plotly and seaborn</b> 
                            as well as other technologies, like <b>dataiku, databricks and DevOps</b>.
                            <br>
                            While in Braskem, I also had the opportunity to guide meetings with stakeholders, keep a close contact with other areas to understand the comming data,
                            to track the status of ongoing projects and models, and to search for possibles improvements for the areas of the company.
                            <br>
                            I'm always learning new things, using <b>creativity</b>ü§Ø to solve problems and thirsty for <b>innovation</b>. I believe that under certain point of view
                            everthing can be interestingü§©.
                            <br>
                            All of my projects will be listed on this portfolio. 
                            Here, you can find some basic information about them. 
                            However, if you are interested in more detailed information, you can always read the README file on the GitHub project page or ask me by email or LinkedIn.
