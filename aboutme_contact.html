                            HiüòÅ! Welcome to my portfolio of coding projectsüíª.
                            I am Pedro, a Brazilian student pursuing a <b>Materials Engineering</b> degree at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul) since 2018 and expecting to graduate by the end of 2024.
                            <br>
                            You may be wondering how I got into coding while studying Materials Engineering, which is mostly related to Chemistry. Actually, it's quite simple:
                            <br>
                            At some point during my degree (I really don't remember exactly when), I took a class that introduced me to the C language. 
                            While my classmates hated it, I very much enjoyed it, and that's when I realized that programming is all about <b>challengesüéØ and logicüßê</b>. 
                            Since then, I've been studying programming and focusing more on related topics.
                            I was a student at <b>Oracle Next Education (ONE)</b> program, from Oracle, where I learned programming languages such as 
                            <b>Java Object-Oriented and Spring Framework</b>, data related topics such as <b>SQL</b>,
                            as well as improved my personal skills. 
                            As part of ONE I have also been challenged to create programs based on initial ideas and proposals.
                            In addition, I am studying and working <b>Python</b> especially in Data Science 
                            <br>
                            As part of my degree program, I also did an internship at the <b>"Instituto SENAI de Inova√ß√£o (ISI) em Engenharia de Pol√≠meros"</b>, 
                            which was focused on developing <b>innovative</b>üí° projects to meet industry demands. 
                            This institute is inspired on the German <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>.
                            <br>
                            Today I am an intern at <b>Braskem</b> company, where I work with <b>Data Science, Labs Digitalization and Innovation</b> applied to polymeric materials, 
                            and because of that I am able to continuosly improve my coding, Data Science skills and enrich my graduation. In this internship experience, all projects
                            I worked until today required data treat and exploration, which was done mainly with <b>Python, Pandas and Numpy</b>, also some projects required others
                            technologies such as Image Featurization with <b>OpenCV, PIL and scikit-image</b>, Machine Learning with <b>scikit-learn</b>, signal exploration manipulation
                            with <b>scipy</b>, RPA (automation) with <b>TKinter and Pyautogui</b>, Data Visualization with <b>matplotlib, plotly and seaborn</b> 
                            as well as other technologies, like <b>dataiku, databricks and DevOps</b>.
                            <br>
                            I'm always learning new things, using <b>creativity</b>ü§Ø to solve problems and thirsty for <b>innovation</b>. I believe that under certain point of view
                            everthing can be interestingü§©.
                            <br>
                            All of my projects, including personal projects and ONE challenge projects, will be listed on this portfolio. 
                            Here, you can find some basic information about them. 
                            However, if you are interested in more detailed information, you can always read the README file on the GitHub project page or ask me.
