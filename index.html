                            Hi! Welcome to my portfolio of coding projects.
                            <br>
                            I am Pedro, a 23-years-old Brazilian student pursuing a <b>Materials Engineering</b> degree at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul) since 2018 and expecting to graduate by the midst of 2024.
                            <br>
                            You may be wondering how I got into coding while studying Materials Engineering, which is mostly related to Chemistry. Actually, it's quite simple:
                            <br>
                            At some point during my degree (I really don't remember exactly when), I took a class that introduced us to the C language. 
                            While my classmates hated it, I very much enjoyed it, and that's when I realized that programming is all about <b>challenges and logic</b>. 
                            Since then, I've been studying programming and focusing more on related topics.
                            Currently, I am part of the <b>Oracle Next Education (ONE)</b> program, from Oracle, where I am learning programming languages such as 
                            <b>Java Object-Oriented and Spring Framework</b>, data related topics such as <b>SQL</b>,
                            as well as improving my personal skills. 
                            As part of ONE I have also been challenged to create programs based on initial ideas and proposals.
                            In addition, I am studying <b>Python</b> and related areas such as <b>Data Science</b>, including data visualization. 
                            <br>
                            As part of my degree program, I am also in an internship at the <b>"Instituto SENAI de Inovação (ISI) em Engenharia de Polímeros"</b>, 
                            which is focused on developing <b>innovative</b> products to meet industry demands. 
                            This institute is inspired on the German <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>.
                            <br>
                            I'm always learning new things, using <b>creativity</b> to solve problems and thirsty for <b>innovation</b>. I believe that under certain point of view
                            everthing can be interesting.
                            <br>
                            All of my projects, including personal projects and ONE challenge projects, will be listed on this portfolio. 
                            Here, you can find some basic information about them. 
                            However, if you are interested in more detailed information, you can always read the README file on the GitHub project page or even ask me.
                            <br>
                            If you got interested in contacting me for any reason, you can find my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles at the bottom of this page,
