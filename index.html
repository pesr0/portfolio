                            Hi! Welcome to my portfolio of coding projects.
                            <br>
                            I am Pedro, a 23-years-old Brazilian student pursuing a <b>Materials Engineering</b> degree at UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul) since 2018 and expecting to graduate by the midst of 2024.
                            <br>
                            You may be wondering how I got into coding while studying Materials Engineering, which is mostly related to Chemistry. Actually, it's quite simple:
                            <br>
                            At some point during my degree (I really don't remember exactly when), I took a class that introduced us to the C language. 
                            While my classmates hated it, I very much enjoyed it, and that's when I realized that programming is all about <b>challenges and logic</b>. 
                            Since then, I've been studying programming and focusing more on related topics.
                            Currently, I am part of the <b>Oracle Next Education (ONE)</b> program, from Oracle, where I am learning programming languages such as 
                            <b>Java Object-Oriented and Spring Framework</b>, data related topics such as <b>SQL</b>,
                            as well as improving my personal skills. 
                            As part of ONE I have also been challenged to create programs based on initial ideas and proposals.
                            In addition, I am studying <b>Python</b> and related areas such as <b>Data Science</b>, including data visualization. 
                            <br>
                            As part of my degree program, I am also in an internship at the <b>"Instituto SENAI de Inova√ß√£o (ISI) em Engenharia de Pol√≠meros"</b>, 
                            which is focused on developing <b>innovative</b> products to meet industry demands. 
                            This institute is inspired on the German <b>Fraunhofer Institute</b>.
                            <br>
                            I'm always learning new things, using <b>creativity</b> to solve problems and thirsty for <b>innovation</b>. I believe that under certain point of view
                            everthing can be interesting.
                            <br>
                            All of my projects, including personal projects and ONE challenge projects, will be listed on this portfolio. 
                            Here, you can find some basic information about them. 
                            However, if you are interested in more detailed information, you can always read the README file on the GitHub project page or even ask me.
                            <br>

                            This project was the first coding project I ever did, it was done as part of the ONE program in format of a challenge.
                            It is basically a cipher (both an encoder and a decoder). You insert a text you want to encrypt, and than the program returns the encrypted format.
                            <br>
                            This program also implements some restrictions, e.g. you may not insert uppercase letters. And it has a button to copy the generated content.
                            <br>
                            For this program it wasn't used any framework. It was used only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can find and access the program in the following links:

                            This project was the second project I worked on. It was  a personal project aimed at learning and improving my coding skils.
                            <br>
                            It consists in a To-Do List organizer where you may insert tasks you want to do and check them as it gets done.
                            In this program you are able to generate inumerous lists and insert tasks into them, as well as add a title for each list. 
                            The program also has a guide for use, with more details for use.

                            This program was another program that I worked on by myself. I realized that it was very laborious to start a WhatsApp chat without having
                            the targtet number in your personal contacts. So I wrote a simple code to start a chat with a WhatsApp number without the need to add that number
                            to personal contacts. The script works both on WhatsApp web version and phone version

                            This program was the first Back End program I did. It was done as part of the ONE program.
                            <br>
                            The main idea for the program was a currency converter program. The main proposal was a program with fixed
                            currency converter rates, but this one was done with an API with minute updated currency rates. 
                            <br>
                            For this program no framework was used. Only Java with some libraries, IDE Eclipse and Apache Maven were used.
