                        During braskem internship a lot of projects were developed, and basically every single project required Python for it development,
                        along with python other libraries/frameworks were also used, these are going to be mentioned in the projects description below.
                        <br>
                        Also, since the projects were done inside a company, they are protected with Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and because of that
                        some sensitive information about the project will not be shared here.
                        <br>
                        I appreciate your interest in my journey!

                            There was a task, where a certain type of data should be retrieved from peaks in signals, but sometimes these peaks were merged togheter
                            (when a signal has two peaks it is called bimodal). So this project aimed to take those bimodal signals and make a deconvolution of the peaks in it
                            returning what the peak would be without the interference of another. So by having the "clean" peak, it was possible to retrieve the desired information
                            from the peaks.

                            Sometimes we needed information from image, these images often were "engineering" images, so it was not as simple as extracting text from images with tesseract.
                            In this project we utilized the numerical value represented by every pixel to gather insights and get relevant info from the image. This process of transforming
                            and object (in this case a image) in numbers (in this case pixels values) is called featurization. In the end we were able to gather the info we needed and also
                            identify specifics geometry objects in the image with featurization. This project was also deployed online, in order to make it able for whoever needed.

                            We have a huge set of sigals from a certain analsys technique, each one different from another. And often we receive a new signal,
                            which can be different from the other or very similar to one of them, and this new peak should be classified taking that in consideration. 
                            This task of classifying the new signal was done manually by one of the analysts, and considering that we have an enormous set of signal, this task is
                            extremely difficult and laborious. Knowing that, this project aimed to develop a ML model, trained with the original signals and classify the new signal
                            based on the orignals.

                            Since braskem is also a research company, it has a lot of equipament to run analytical techniques, and often these equipament have their own software
                            to treat the data the equipament generate. Since braskem is a huge company, a lot of analysis are done and takes a lot of time to work manually on those
                            softwares to extract the data generated by the equipament. Hence, to save analists time, soma automations (RPA) were developed to extract the data automagically
                            from the softwares. Also, some automations envolved extract data from files such as pdfs and images.

                            Since braskem has a enormous projects portfolio, and those projects are distributed on more than one software (and more than one database),
                            it is hard to compare manually (analysts did it manually) if all the databases have the correct information. 
                            Based on that a program was developed to compare the content on both databases, where a report from each database was generated and than used
                            as input in this program, and the program returns an excel file with a summary of what is missing or not correct in each report.

                            Even if all of the projects didnt work out as expected, in a way or another those projects generated knowledge. Considering that, some parts on the projects
                            were tranformed in functions and keeped separated, in that way we can reuse the code in a future project without having the work of coding it all again.
                            Those functions envolves every kind of task, since image editing, to str comparator or even matrix sampling. The functions were all commented and well documented.
