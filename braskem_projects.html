                        During braskem internship a lot of projects were developed, and basically every single project required Python for it development,
                        along with python other libraries/frameworks were also used, these are going to be mentioned in the projects description below.
                        <br>
                        Also, since the projects were done inside a company, they are protected with Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and because of that
                        some sensitive information about the project will not be shared here.
                        <br>

                            Development of a <u><b>pipeline</b></u> where a raw data file containing a signal from a specific material analysis 
                            technique is used as input. After automated <u><b>normalization</b></u> of this signal, <b><u>features are extracted</u></b> and used as 
                            input data in a pre-trained <u><b>Random Forest</b></u> (sklearn) model to predict the type of material corresponding to 
                            the signal. Based on this pipeline and model, a <b><u>software</u></b> solution (<u><b>Python</b></u>) with a graphical interface 
                            (<u><b>Tkinter</b></u>) was developed to distribute the tool to analysts. One of the challenges of the project was the 
                            limited number of data points for each material, but by defining classes of similar materials, this issue was 
                            overcome. The signals used for analysis are also stored for future model improvement. Previously, this 
                            analysis took about 30 minutes for experienced analysts and hours for new analysts, but with this solution, 
                            it can now be performed in seconds with an accuracy of approximately 75%, while also removing the need 
                            for technical knowledge to interpret the signal (democratizing the analysis). For this project, constant 
                            <u><b>communication and meetings with other departments</b></u> were essential to collect data and monitor software 
                            performance.

                            Since braskem is also a research company, it has a lot of equipament to run analytical techniques, and often these equipament have their own software
                            to treat the data the equipament generate. Since braskem is a huge company, a lot of analysis are done and takes a lot of time to work manually on those
                            softwares to extract the data generated by the equipament. Hence, to save analists time, soma automations (RPA) were developed to extract the data automagically
                            from the softwares. Also, some automations envolved extract data from files such as pdfs and images.

                            Since braskem has a enormous projects portfolio, and those projects are distributed on more than one software (and more than one database),
                            it is hard to compare manually (analysts did it manually) if all the databases have the correct information. 
                            Based on that a program was developed to compare the content on both databases, where a report from each database was generated and than used
                            as input in this program, and the program returns an excel file with a summary of what is missing or not correct in each report.
